    "Inflation is a crucial economic indicator that reflects the rate at which the general price level of goods and services in an economy is rising. For policymakers, businesses, and individuals, understanding the drivers of inflation is vital for making informed decisions. In Indonesia, as in many countries, inflation can be influenced by a variety of factors including economic policies, global market conditions, and domestic economic indicators. In Indonesia inflation can be measured by Consumer Price Index that monthly published by the central bank of Indonesia (Bank Indonesia). There are several group of goods to be measured: Foods, Prepared Foods, Housing, Clothing, Health, Education, and Transportation. But in this project we will only focus on Food, Housing, and Clothing comodities which they're the basic needs of the society."

    "High and unstable inflation presents a major challenge for Indonesiaâ€™s economy and its people. Increasing prices can reduce purchasing power, raise the cost of living, and worsen social inequality. As a result, low-income individuals and families may face greater economic hardship and increased risk of falling into poverty. Understanding and identifying the drivers of inflation accurately is crucial for formulating effective policies and mitigating its negative impacts on society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches often struggle to capture the complex and dynamic nature of inflation. Identifying and understanding the multifaceted factors influencing inflation requires sophisticated analysis beyond conventional methods. Machine learning techniques are particularly valuable in this context. By applying machine learning, we can analyze large and complex datasets to uncover patterns, measure the impact of economic factors, and gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inflation."
